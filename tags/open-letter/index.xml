      <title>An Open Letter to Dr. Subramanian Swamy</title>

      <description>Dear Dr. Subramanian Swamy,
This in reference to the below picture shared by the page run by ShankhNaad in your name. Please allow me to address this latest instance of imbecility.
Your contention that industrial and vehicular pollution is considered &amp;lsquo;No problem&amp;rsquo; can only result from a mind boggling level of cognitive dissonance or a mala fide intention to mislead. There is a reason why factories have to get an environmental clearance and vehicles have to meet Bharat Stage emission norms.</description>

      <description>Dear Mr. Chetan Bhagat,
I have never been a fan of your cutesy novels targeted at clueless young adults. However, I am extremely disturbed by your attempts to &amp;lsquo;enlighten&amp;rsquo; your readership by projecting your partisan views as the neutral and objective voice of reason.
The major chunk of your fan base is made up of people who have little to no understanding of political issues and they tend to treat your half assed political ramblings as gospel.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Devyani Khobragade</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/an/</link>

      <description>Dear Miss Khobragade,
The government and the people of India were on your side when the issues were international law and diplomatic protocol. Now that you are back in India, you are requested to stop playing the martyr. You see, nobody gives a rodent&amp;rsquo;s posterior if you cannot visit your sons should they choose to study and work in the US.
Best wishes,</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Modibots</title>

      <description>Dear Modibots,
On the Internet, spammers are considered the scum of humanity. By indiscriminately spamming people&amp;rsquo;s inboxes, you are only giving credence to the idea that you are a bunch of obnoxiously ignorant boisterous knuckle-dragging sheeple who do not belong in the civilized world, let alone the Internet.
Best wishes,</description>
