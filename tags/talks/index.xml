      <description>Gave an introductory talk on CoAP at the 5th RFC&amp;rsquo;s We Love meetup. Turnout was low, probably owing to the rains and the festive season. It was still fun and had great discussions.

      <description>Gave an introductory interactive tutorial on using Git. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the slides on time but managed cover everything on the agenda.
Now that the talk is done, I&amp;rsquo;m don&amp;rsquo;t feel especially inclined to complete the slides.

      <description>Gave an introductory talk on Linux at Koneru Lakshmiah University, with Vamsifollowing up with a talk on Bugs and Hacks as a part of the ‘workshop’ organised by the KLU Linux Users Group. With about 150 newbish students in attendance, it was fun albeit in a masochistic kind of a way.
Here’s a shitty picture from the talk, courtesy of Vamsi:
And here are the sildes: Edit: I lost the slides.</description>
