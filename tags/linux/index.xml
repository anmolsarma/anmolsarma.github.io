      <title>DCCP: The socket type you probably never heard of</title>

      <description>TL;DR: DCCP is a relatively newer transport layer protocol which draws from both TCP and UDP. Jump straight to the example C code.
Background Historically, the majority of the traffic on the Internet has been over TCP which provides a reliable connection-oriented stream between two hosts. UDP has been mainly used by applications whose brief transfers would be unacceptably slowed by TCP&amp;rsquo;s connection establishment overhead or those for which timeliness is more important than reliability.</description>

      <title>Das Blinkenlights on the MSP430 Launchpad with Linux</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/msp430-launchpad-linux/</link>

      <description>TI’s MSP430 LaunchPad development kit offers some serious bang for the buck. You get two modern 16-bit microcontrollers, a programmer-cum-debugger with pins broken out and a USB cable for less than 5 USD inclusive of shipping. TI even provides two free (as in beer) IDE’s for Windows. Linux support though was a bit sketchy when the board was first released.
Things of course have greatly improved and getting the Launchpad to work with Linux is now a breeze.</description>

      <description>Mole Nama
A historical account of the Mole’ani people in the Free Lands
 -Inestimabel Montcastellus
  We Mole’ani are a Geekic people, who like millions of other races call the Free Lands home. However, our people originally came from the other side; the Dark Lands that shall not be named. The Dark Lands were under monopolistic rule of the Borg and their brethren. Piracy was common and so were the viral diseases which accompanied the booty.</description>

      <title>Talk @ KLU: Linux? Say whaat?!</title>

      <description>Gave an introductory talk on Linux at Koneru Lakshmiah University, with Vamsifollowing up with a talk on Bugs and Hacks as a part of the ‘workshop’ organised by the KLU Linux Users Group. With about 150 newbish students in attendance, it was fun albeit in a masochistic kind of a way.
Here’s a shitty picture from the talk, courtesy of Vamsi:
And here are the sildes: Edit: I lost the slides.</description>
