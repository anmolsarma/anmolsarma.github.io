      <title>DCCP: The socket type you probably never heard of</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/dccp/</link>

      <description>TL;DR: DCCP is a relatively newer transport layer protocol which draws from both TCP and UDP. Jump straight to the example C code.
Background Historically, the majority of the traffic on the Internet has been over TCP which provides a reliable connection-oriented stream between two hosts. UDP has been mainly used by applications whose brief transfers would be unacceptably slowed by TCP&amp;rsquo;s connection establishment overhead or those for which timeliness is more important than reliability.</description>

      <title>Lazy Performance Comparison of WordPress and Ghost</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/lazy-performance-comparison-of-wordpress-and-ghost/</link>

      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/lazy-performance-comparison-of-wordpress-and-ghost/</guid>
      <description>So, I switched to a new blogging platform. Again. After trying out a static approach, I moved back to a WordPress when I stumbled across OpenShift (And their fantastic free plan). That was well over two years ago. In the meantime, I hardly blogged and didn&amp;rsquo;t really run into any issues but the blog did feel a tad sluggish.
Fast-forward to yesterday when I had a sudden impulse to try something new.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Dr. Subramanian Swamy</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/an-open-letter-to-dr-subramanian-swamy/</link>

      <description>Dear Dr. Subramanian Swamy,
This in reference to the below picture shared by the page run by ShankhNaad in your name. Please allow me to address this latest instance of imbecility.
Your contention that industrial and vehicular pollution is considered &amp;lsquo;No problem&amp;rsquo; can only result from a mind boggling level of cognitive dissonance or a mala fide intention to mislead. There is a reason why factories have to get an environmental clearance and vehicles have to meet Bharat Stage emission norms.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Chetan Bhagat</title>

      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/an-open-letter-to-chetan-bhagat/</guid>
      <description>Dear Mr. Chetan Bhagat,
I have never been a fan of your cutesy novels targeted at clueless young adults. However, I am extremely disturbed by your attempts to &amp;lsquo;enlighten&amp;rsquo; your readership by projecting your partisan views as the neutral and objective voice of reason.
The major chunk of your fan base is made up of people who have little to no understanding of political issues and they tend to treat your half assed political ramblings as gospel.</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Devyani Khobragade</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/an/</link>

      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/an/</guid>
      <description>Dear Miss Khobragade,
The government and the people of India were on your side when the issues were international law and diplomatic protocol. Now that you are back in India, you are requested to stop playing the martyr. You see, nobody gives a rodent&amp;rsquo;s posterior if you cannot visit your sons should they choose to study and work in the US.
Best wishes,</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Modibots</title>

      <description>Dear Modibots,
On the Internet, spammers are considered the scum of humanity. By indiscriminately spamming people&amp;rsquo;s inboxes, you are only giving credence to the idea that you are a bunch of obnoxiously ignorant boisterous knuckle-dragging sheeple who do not belong in the civilized world, let alone the Internet.
Best wishes,</description>

      <title>Art of Living Foundation&#39;s Kurshed Batliwala Debunked</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/kurshed-batliwala-debunked/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2013 10:07:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/kurshed-batliwala-debunked/</guid>
      <description>A critical look at Khurshed Batliwala’s talk, “Technology of Spirituality” delivered at Ruia College, Mumbai.
  Mr. Batliwala makes a number of extraordinary claims about the state of ancient Indian science and technology. Most of them however, turn out to be exaggerations, misinterpretations or outright fabrications. He then attributes all scientific progress to ‘spirituality’.
The talk is nothing more than a sales pitch for Mr. Mr. Ravi Shankar’s ‘Art of Living Foundation’.</description>

      <description>Gave an introductory talk on Linux, basically a rehash of the talk I gave at KLU a couple of years ago.

      <title>Talk @ EmWare: Getting Started with Git</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/talk-emware-getting-started-with-git/</link>

      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/talk-emware-getting-started-with-git/</guid>
      <description>Gave an introductory interactive tutorial on using Git. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish the slides on time but managed cover everything on the agenda.
Now that the talk is done, I&amp;rsquo;m don&amp;rsquo;t feel especially inclined to complete the slides.

      <title>Defeating India&#39;s Central Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/defeating-the-central-monitoring-system/</link>

      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/defeating-the-central-monitoring-system/</guid>
      <description>The Government of India has rolled out the Central Monitoring System which will allow it to access any piece of data passing through an Indian service provider. This means the government can now read all your text messages, emails and call records.
Because privacy does not bring in votes, it is highly unlikely that any political party will oppose this system. Circumventing this system however, is rather simple using PGP or any other munition grade cryptographic scheme.</description>

      <description>Here it goes again: After a couple of attempts with Blogger, a dozen iterations with WordPress, a very brief tryst with Drupal and a false start with Bloggart, I’ve now decided to ditch dynamic content management systems and give Octopress a spin.
I like the idea of a statically generated site I can deploy anywhere. I used Sphinx for a documentation once and the experience with was pretty good. However, getting Sphinx to work for a personal blog seemed to be too much work, so Octopress it is.</description>

      <title>Das Blinkenlights on the MSP430 Launchpad with Linux</title>
      <link>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/msp430-launchpad-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2013 19:06:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.anmolsarma.in/post/msp430-launchpad-linux/</guid>
      <description>TI’s MSP430 LaunchPad development kit offers some serious bang for the buck. You get two modern 16-bit microcontrollers, a programmer-cum-debugger with pins broken out and a USB cable for less than 5 USD inclusive of shipping. TI even provides two free (as in beer) IDE’s for Windows. Linux support though was a bit sketchy when the board was first released.
Things of course have greatly improved and getting the Launchpad to work with Linux is now a breeze.</description>

      <description>Mole Nama
A historical account of the Mole’ani people in the Free Lands
 -Inestimabel Montcastellus
  We Mole’ani are a Geekic people, who like millions of other races call the Free Lands home. However, our people originally came from the other side; the Dark Lands that shall not be named. The Dark Lands were under monopolistic rule of the Borg and their brethren. Piracy was common and so were the viral diseases which accompanied the booty.</description>

      <description>Gave an introductory talk on Linux at Koneru Lakshmiah University, with Vamsifollowing up with a talk on Bugs and Hacks as a part of the ‘workshop’ organised by the KLU Linux Users Group. With about 150 newbish students in attendance, it was fun albeit in a masochistic kind of a way.
Here’s a shitty picture from the talk, courtesy of Vamsi:

      <description>This is the 11th iteration of my blog/homepage. I’ve finally found a setup that I like (Thanks to Bloggart!) and unless I run into any major issues, I’m probably going to stick with it. Maybe now I’ll finally stop resetting the site and get down to actually blogging!
